```{r}

# Richness of total sample (intact + relic DNA)
Stot <- 1000

# Number of reads or individuals in total sample
Ntot <- 10000

# Richness ratio (number of taxa in total DNA / number of taxa in relic DNA)
rr <- 2.2

# Richness of intact and relic DNA pool 
Sint <- round(Stot/rr, 0)
Srel <- Stot - Sint

# "Percent decrease in richnes" sensus Carini et al. 2017
richness.decrease <- 1 - (Sint/Stot)

# Vector of equal relative abundances for total sample
SampTot <- rep(Ntot/Stot, Stot)

# Vector of equal relative abundances for intact sample (minus taxa from relic)
SampInt <- c(rep(0, Srel), SampTot[(Srel+1):length(SampTot)])

# Create site-by-species matrix
paired <- cbind(SampTot, SampInt)
paired.sqrt <- sqrt(relic)

# Caluclate Bray-Curtis distance
require(vegan)
paired.bc <- vegdist(t(paired), method = "bray")
paired.bc.sqrt <- vegdist(t(paired.sqrt), method = "bray")
paired.bc
```

Conclusion: Minimum dissimiliarity when 55% of species are only found in relic pool (i.e., richess ratio of 2.2) is 0.37. Carini et al. (2017) found that dissimilarity in a soil sample (18) with richness ratio of 2.2 was ~0.69. Therefore, their richness ratios and Bray-Curtis values are mathematically consistent.
